# Covid-Vaccine-DataBase


## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop and build a database application for a real-world domain. Step-by-step, designing a schema, create a database using DB2, populate the database with data, maintain, query and update your data, develop application programs, and implement a user-friendly interface. 

## Creating a Data Model.

Creating a Data Model to connect every component of the proccess and obtain an efficient diagram which can later be implemented to form the full fledged data base. 

- The data model can be found in the `src/model/ER.pdf`
- Translation of the ER diagram as well as the assumptions and restrictions can be found in the `src/model/project.pdf`

## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop models to classify the MNSIT datasets which is composed of letters and digits.
- The data model can be found in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/comp-551-fall-2021/data" target="_blank">Kaggle </a>
- To create Tables and Insert data, Please run the following files in order `src/model/sql_files/createtbl.sh` and `src/model/sql_files/loaddata.sh`
- To remove all the tables please run the following file: `src/model/sql_files/droptable.sh`

## Creating a backend for the database 
Creating a bakend in Java for the relational scehma that was designed earlier
- User selects the menu option based on what they would like to do, program performs that action and goes back to displaying the menu.
- Specific options for User include the following: <br>
  `VaccineApp Main Menu`<br>
     1. `Add a Person`<br>
     2. `Assign a slot to a Person`<br>
     3. `Enter Vaccination information`<br>
     4. `Exit Application`<br> 
 `Please Enter Your Option:`<br>
  
- Conducting specific query commands inside the java to allow minimal information from the user
- A few examples of the application specific to the database can be found in the `src/model/project3.pdf` file.

## A few SQL commands
- A few SQL commands specific to the database can be found in the `src/model/project.pdf` file.
